## Marine ecological niche modelling and global climate change
### [Evaluation]

#### Individual research study

Each student will conduct an individual research study addressing (1) the interactions OR (2) the impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity. The students can choose one of the following topics:

[1] Identify the main climatic drivers shaping the distribution of one or more marine species;<br>
[2] Predict present distributional ranges for one or more marine species;<br>
[3] Project future range shifts for one or more marine species;<br>
[4] Predict potential marine invasion processes for one or more marine species;<br>
[0] Additional topics can be proposed (in such case, please contact the professor).<br><br>

To successfully conduct the individual research study, the students must perform the following tasks:

[1] Gather biodiversity data for one or more marine species [Practical session S05];<br>
[2] Gather environmental data to model the distribution of one or more marine species [Practical session S06];<br>
[3] Model the distribution of one or more marine species and conduct one of the topics addressing the interactions or impacts of climate changes on marine biodiversity [Practical sessions S07 - S10];<br>
[4] Write a report with the major results and findings;<br>
[5] Document the R script used to conduct the analyses and provide it as supplementary information of the report;<br><br>

The report should be up to **8000 words with references**, and with the following **paper format**:

[1] Abstract: What did I do in a nutshell? (max. 300 words)<br>
[2] Introduction: What is the problem?<br>
[3] Methods: How did I solve the problem?<br>
[4] Results: What did I find out?<br>
[5] Discussion: What does it mean?<br>
[6] References: Whose work did I refer to?<br>

To successfully write the report, the students must:

[1] Formulate a relevant research ecological question (e.g., in the scope of climate change impacts);<br>
[2] Formulate an hypothesis, based on the general theories presented in the lectures or from the course literature;<br>
[3] Build a conceptual model to address the research question in their study system;<br>
[4] Read the scientific literature in a systematic, quantitative way, to collect, assess the evidence for the different components of their model and hypotheses, and formulate conclusions and recommendations.<br><br>

#### Major milestones

[16 March] Brief presentation (5 minutes) + Brief discussion (5 minutes).<br>
The student will perform a small presentation where they formulate a research ecological question and hypothesis based on literature revision and show a conceptual model to address the research question. Also, preliminary biodiversity and environmental data can be shown.

[20 April] Final presentation (10 minutes) + Brief discussion (5 minutes).<br>
The student will perform a presentation where they show the major findings of their research study addressing the interactions or impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity.<br><br>

[31 May] Final report (10 minutes) (up to 8000 words with references, paper format).<br>
The students must send the final report to jmassis@ualg.pt.<br><br>

[31 May] Documented R markdown script as supplementary information of the final report.<br>
The students must send the documented R markdown script to jmassis@ualg.pt.<br><br>


#### Mid-term exam

[11 May] Multiple choice exam (up to 90 minutes) with 4 essay questions (for PhD students).<br>
The student must get, at least, 9.5 out of 20.<br>

### [Final grade]

Individual research = (Brief presentation * 0.1 ) + (Final presentation * 0.2 ) + (Final report * 0.6 ) + (Markdown script * 0.1 )<br>
Final grade = (Individual research * 0.7) + (Mid-term exam * 0.3)
