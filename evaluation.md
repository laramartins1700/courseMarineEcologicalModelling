## Marine ecological niche modelling and global climate change
### [Evaluation]

#### Individual research study

Each student will conduct an individual research study addressing (1) the interactions OR (2) impact of global climate changes (past OR future) on marine biodiversity.<br><br>

The individual research study can (1) identify the main climatic drivers shaping the distribution of one or more marine species, (2) predict present distributional ranges for one or more marine species, (3) project future range shifts for one or more marine species or (4) predict marine invasion processes for one or more marine species. Additional topics can be proposed (in such case, please contact the professor)<br><br>

- [Week 5] Presentation / Discussion : 5 + 10 minutes (10% of grade)
- [Week 10] Presentation : 10 + 5 minutes (20% of grade)
- [Week 14] Final report (up to 15 pages without references, paper format; 60% of grade)
- [Week 14] Documented R markdown script as supplementary information of the final report (10% of grade)

> Students must formulate a relevant research ecological question (e.g., in the scope of climate change impacts).
> Students must formulate an hypothesis, based on the general theories presented in the lectures or from the course literature;
> Students must build a conceptual model to address the research question in their study system.
> Students must read the scientific literature in a systematic, quantitative way, to collect, assess the evidence for the different components of their model and hypotheses, and formulate conclusions and recommendations.

#### Mid-term exam

- Exam (multiple choice + 4 essay questions, up to 90 minutes; at least 9.5).

#### Final grade

- Final grade = (Individual research study * 0.7) + (Mid-term exam * 0.3)
