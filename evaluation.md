## Marine ecological niche modelling and global climate change
### [Evaluation]

#### Individual research study

Each student needs to write an individual research study addressing the interactions OR impact of global climate changes (past OR future) in one of the different levels of biodiversity. This can be (1) identifying the main climatic drivers shaping distributions, (2) predicting distributional ranges, (3) projecting  future range shifts, (4) predicting marine invasion processes, etc.<br><br>

- [Week 5] Presentation / Discussion : 5 + 10 minutes (10% of grade)
- [Week 10] Presentation : 10 + 5 minutes (20% of grade)

> Students must formulate a relevant research ecological question (e.g., in the scope of climate change impacts).
> Students must formulate an hypothesis, based on the general theories presented in the lectures or from the course literature;
> Students must build a conceptual model to address the research question in their study system.
> Students must read the scientific literature in a systematic, quantitative way, to collect, assess the evidence for the different components of their model and hypotheses, and formulate conclusions and recommendations.

#### Mid-term exam

- Exam (multiple choice + 4 essay questions, up to 90 minutes; at least 9.5).

#### Final grade

- Final grade = (Exam * 0.3) + (individual study * 0.7)
